#Designing The Future 

As devices become increasingly diverse in terms of screen size, input mechanism, usage patterns and user expectations we need to rethink how we design applications.  Rather than the often ugly, fixed-size, chrome-heavy applications of old we need to shift to a more visually appealing, responsive, content-first approach.  Apple's, and now also Microsoft's, products are providing a glimpse of the direction to go but most enterprise software is struggling to adapt. 

This talk will explore the shift in design thinking necessary to move to the increasingly device-agnostic application style that our users expect, and will show how HTML5 is an ideal technology for both this new style of thinking and its corresponding implementation.
